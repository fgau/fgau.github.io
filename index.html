			<div class="post-content">
				<p>for a little side project, i needed small usb cams, preferably for free. i still had old hp elitebooks 8440p, and from their display, i removed the camera, see the picture below. the picture shows always the pinout. next, i soldered the 4 cables together, leaving the GPIO pin unused. no big deal, there is no faster way to get an usb-cam for raspberry and co.
  laptop cam connector     Type-A pinout      Pin Name Wire color Description     1 V(Bus) Red +5 V   2 D- White Data-   3 D+ Green Data+   4 GND Black Ground       soldered with standard usb cable    </p>

				<p>for a django project i needed a exception for the rss feed requests. they are only allowed to request for a set of specific IP addresses. django&rsquo;s feed syndication framework is the base, and i have added a little snippet for receiving the remote address. the HttpRequest.META method reads all available HTTP header informations and for that case we read REMOTE_ADDR. only ip addresses in ip_allow are ready to receive the feed objects.  … </p>
